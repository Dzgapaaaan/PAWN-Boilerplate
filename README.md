Please note that this project is not yet officially released.

PAWN Boilerplate, or PBP, is a solid base for rapidly developing large gamemodes for SA-MP servers.
Everything is organized into modules, which are very easy to create and get started with.

To make this work, a pre-compiler has been created. The pre-compiler will automatically generate a main file linked to all the modules and their contents.

Have a look at the **[Wiki](https://github.com/oscar-broman/PAWN-Boilerplate/wiki)** for more information.
